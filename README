This is my first Github experience, so bear with me.

What I am hoping to create is CSS stylesheets that override the colors of
embedded Gists. Primarily, I wish to port existing GtkSourceView themes and Vim
themes to the Gist embed.css stucture.

Any help is appreciated, as I learn how to use Github. :)
