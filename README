This is my first Github experience, so bear with me.

What I am hoping to create is CSS stylesheets that override the colors of
embedded Gists. Primarily, I wish to 'translate' existing GtkSourceView (gedit)
themes to the Gist embed.css stucture.

The stylesheet for Gists is here:
https://gist.github.com/stylesheets/gist/embed.css

and original gedit themes are here:
http://live.gnome.org/GtkSourceView/StyleSchemes

Any help is appreciated, as I learn how to use Github. :)
